Inova - business presentation website

## Getting started

To run this project locally you can open index.html in your browser. This will not transpile any ES6+ Javascript to older ES5 (capable of running in all browsers). This project will have limited functionality in IE11 for example.

To make it browser compatible we have used Parced, a zero config bundler & transpiler. You can run a browser compatible version of this project by following the steps below.

- Make sure that you have NodeJS installed on your computer.
- Navigate to this folder in your terminal and type `npm install` then type `npm run dev`, this will start a development server locally on your computer.
- Go to `http://localhost:1234` in your browser.

- To run a production ready version of this project type `npm run build` in your terminal and use the contents in the `dist` folder.
